# Vector Databases: An Overview

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and query vector embeddings efficiently. They play a crucial role in modern AI applications, particularly those involving semantic search and recommendation systems.

## What are Vector Embeddings?

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio, etc.) in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture semantic relationships, allowing similar items to be positioned closer together in the vector space.

For example, in text embeddings:
- "dog" and "puppy" would be positioned close together
- "car" and "automobile" would be close together
- "dog" and "car" would be far apart

## Key Features of Vector Databases

1. **Similarity Search**: Find items that are semantically similar using distance metrics (cosine, Euclidean, etc.)
2. **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Algorithms**: Efficient search in high-dimensional spaces
3. **Filtering**: Combine vector search with metadata filtering
4. **Scalability**: Handle millions or billions of vectors efficiently

## Popular Vector Database Solutions

- **Chroma**: Open-source embedding database designed for RAG applications

## Common Applications

- **Semantic Search**: Find documents based on meaning rather than keywords
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest similar products or content
- **Image and Audio Search**: Find similar images or audio clips
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns or outliers
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhance LLM outputs with relevant context
