# Sample Document for Testing

This is a sample text document that we can use to test the document loading API.

## Features of Vector Databases

Vector databases like Chroma are designed for storing and querying vector embeddings efficiently. They are particularly useful for:

1. Semantic search applications
2. Recommendation systems
3. Anomaly detection
4. Natural language processing tasks
5. Image and video search

## Integration with LLMs

When combined with Large Language Models (LLMs), vector databases enable:

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Long-term memory for AI assistants
- Knowledge base creation and querying
- Document summarization and analysis

## Benefits of Chunking

Breaking documents into smaller chunks allows for:

- More precise retrieval of relevant information
- Better handling of context windows
- Improved search performance
- Reduced token usage when working with LLMs

This document should be processed into multiple chunks based on the chunk_size parameter provided to the API.
