# Introduction to LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends LangChain with a graph-based orchestration layer that enables complex agent workflows.

## Key Concepts

### Stateful Execution
LangGraph maintains state throughout the execution of an agent workflow, allowing for more complex reasoning and decision-making processes. This is particularly useful for multi-step tasks that require memory of previous steps.

### Graph-Based Architecture
LangGraph uses a directed graph structure to define the flow of execution:
- **Nodes**: Represent individual components or steps in the workflow
- **Edges**: Define the possible transitions between nodes
- **Conditional Logic**: Determines which path to take based on the current state

### Multi-Actor Systems
LangGraph supports multiple "actors" or agents working together in a coordinated manner, each with their own role and capabilities:
- Specialized agents for different tasks
- Communication between agents
- Coordination of complex workflows

## Common Use Cases

1. **Multi-step reasoning**: Breaking complex problems into manageable steps
2. **Tool use orchestration**: Managing when and how agents use external tools
3. **Agentic workflows**: Creating systems of multiple agents working together
4. **Human-in-the-loop processes**: Integrating human feedback at specific points

## Example: Simple RAG Agent Flow

```
User Query → Retrieve Context → Analyze Context → (Search for More OR Generate Final Answer)
```

In this flow, the agent first retrieves relevant context, analyzes whether it's sufficient, and then either searches for more information or provides a final answer based on the available context.
